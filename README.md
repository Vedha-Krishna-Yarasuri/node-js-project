# nodejs projects on chatbots
in this repository I will be sharing few of my backend codes of chatbots using node js 

IN the file compile.js I have made a chatbot which could complie c,cpp,java,python,node program files and could give the output in the chatbot itself . 

IN the file chatbots-with_api.js (as the name suggests , I used api's) .I made a chatbot which could give the information of weather around them and also the meaning of the word given by user.

IN the file saving-the-input.js I will save the input from chatbot and store in a seperate file and if the name aldready exists in the file it gives out a message saying this name aldready exists...
